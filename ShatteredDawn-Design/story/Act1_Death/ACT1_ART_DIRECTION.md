# Act 1 Art Direction - Death's Domain
*The Undying Settlement*

## **Overall Visual Philosophy**
Death's Domain represents the purgatory of eternal ambiguity - neither living nor dying. The art direction must capture this liminal state through visual contradiction and gradual transformation from grey stagnation to vibrant life.

## **Architectural Style Guide**

### **Gothic Cathedral (Central Hub)**
- **Style**: Weathered Gothic Revival with Romanesque elements
- **Condition**: Partially ruined but structurally sound
- **Materials**: Dark grey stone with lighter mortar lines
- **Details**: Cracked but intact stained glass, exposed wooden beams, worn stone carvings
- **Transformation**: Stone lightens, cracks mend, stained glass regains color

### **Shanty Town Aesthetic**
- **Construction**: Improvised architecture using scavenged materials
- **Materials**: Weathered wood planks, corrugated metal, torn fabric, salvaged brick

## **Character Design Direction**

### **NPCs - Physical Manifestation of Psychological State**
- **Posture**: Slumped, mechanical movements, lack of natural gesture
- **Facial Features**: Gaunt, hollow eyes, expressions frozen in past emotions
- **Clothing**: Practical but worn, colors drained, styles from different eras mixed
- **Transformation**: Gradual improvement in posture, return of natural movement, clothes show care

### **Mira (Key Character)**
- **Initial**: Dirt-stained gardening clothes, hands permanently soil-stained, tools worn smooth
- **Hair**: Unkempt, streaked with premature grey
- **Expression**: Distant, talking to plants more than people
- **Transformation**: Clothes become cleaner, posture straightens, genuine smiles appear

### **Hope (Player Character)**
- **Form**: Begins as sphere of warm light, transitions to chosen archetype
- **Aura**: Subtle golden glow that intensifies with story progression
- **Interaction**: Light responds to emotional moments, brightens near suffering

## **Environmental Storytelling Through Art**

### **Decay Patterns**
- **Stone**: Weathering follows realistic patterns - water damage, structural stress
- **Metal**: Rust and corrosion in logical places
- **Organic**: Dead vegetation in various stages of decomposition
- **Personal Items**: Scattered belongings tell stories of interrupted lives

### **Hope's Visual Impact**
- **Immediate Effect**: 3-meter radius where colors begin to return
- **Progressive Change**: Expanding circles of restoration
- **Plant Life**: Dead vegetation shows first signs of green
- **Architecture**: Cracks begin to mend, surfaces show signs of care

### **Lighting Design Philosophy**
- **Pre-Hope**: Flat, overcast lighting with harsh shadows
- **Hope's Influence**: Warm, directional light that creates inviting spaces
- **Interior Spaces**: Candlelight and firelight become warmer and more welcoming
- **Stained Glass**: Gradual return of colored light filtering through cathedral windows

## **Atmospheric Design Elements**

### **Weather and Sky**
- **Initial**: Perpetual overcast, no weather variation
- **Progression**: Clouds begin to break, hints of blue sky
- **Final**: Natural weather patterns return, dramatic lighting possible

### **Particle Effects**
- **Dust Motes**: Heavy, settling dust in abandoned areas
- **Hope's Presence**: Subtle golden particles that drift upward
- **Transformation**: Gentle sparkles as objects restore themselves
- **Garden Growth**: Visible pollen and seeds carried on gentle breezes

### **Sound-Visual Correlation**
- **Silence**: Visual emptiness, lack of movement
- **Hope's Influence**: Visual activity increases with returning sounds
- **Restoration**: Visual bustle matches returning community life

## **Technical Art Guidelines**

### **Texture Approach**
- **Base Textures**: High contrast between worn/new, dirty/clean
- **Layering**: Multiple texture layers to show age and restoration

- **Characters**: Slightly stylized to emphasize emotional states
- **Props**: Realistic wear patterns that tell stories
- **Vegetation**: Transition from dead/grey to living/green models

### **Animation Principles**
- **NPCs**: Initially stiff, mechanical movements becoming more fluid
