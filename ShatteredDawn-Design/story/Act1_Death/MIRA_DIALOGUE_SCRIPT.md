## **üó£Ô∏è Ongoing Dialogue Script**
*Player cannot respond - Mira speaks as a companion throughout Act I*

### **After Armor Selection (Pre-Combat Tutorial)**
**MIRA** *(watching the player in their new form)*  
Look at you... it's been so long since I've seen hope take shape. You remind me of... well, of better times.

*She glances toward her withered garden.*

**MIRA**  
I used to tend these plants every day. Even when they stopped growing, I kept trying. Foolish, perhaps, but... what else was there to do?

*Distant sounds of approaching enemies.*

**MIRA** *(concerned)*  
Something's coming. The lost ones... they wander without purpose, but sometimes they find their way here. You'll need to help us, won't you? I... I believe you can.

---

### **After Combat Tutorial Victory**
**MIRA** *(amazed)*  
You fought for us. When was the last time someone fought for anything here? I can't even remember.

*She looks at her hands, noticing they're steadier.*

**MIRA**  
Something feels different. In me, I mean. Like a weight I'd forgotten I was carrying has... lightened, just a little.

---

### **After Level 1 Completion - "The Mercy of Ending"**
**MIRA** *(noticing a single flower bud in her garden)*  
Is that...? No, it can't be. But it is! A bud! The first sign of life in my garden in... in ages.

*She touches the bud gently.*

**MIRA**  
You did this, didn't you? Just by being here, by caring. I'd forgotten what it felt like to have something to tend to that might actually grow.

*Pause, looking at the player with growing wonder.*

**MIRA**  
And Jorik... you gave him peace. Real peace. He's been trapped between life and death for so long. Thank you for letting him rest.

---

### **After Level 2 Completion - "The Last Will"**
**MIRA** *(settlement showing first signs of color)*  
Elder Thane is speaking differently now. Have you noticed? He's not talking about the old council meetings anymore. He's... here. Present. With us.

*She gestures toward the emergency supplies.*

**MIRA**  
And these supplies... we haven't had proper food stores in longer than I can remember. You're not just bringing hope - you're bringing practical help too.

---

### **After Level 3 Completion - "The Missing Patrol"**
**MIRA** *(more animated, colors slightly warmer around her)*  
The others are starting to talk again. Real conversations, not just the same old phrases we've been repeating for... well, forever.

*She gestures toward other NPCs who are now occasionally interacting.*

**MIRA**  
Elder Thane actually smiled yesterday. I haven't seen him smile since... since before the grey took hold. You're changing us, little light. Changing everything.

*She looks at the returned scouts.*

**MIRA**  
And bringing our people home. Kael was so worried about them. Now look - they're talking, laughing even. When did we last hear laughter?

---

### **After Level 4 Completion - "Shattered Reflections"**
**MIRA** *(garden showing multiple buds, her voice stronger)*  
Vera's daughter is back, and she's... different. Stronger. Whatever you did in that maze, it helped her face something she needed to face.

*She tends to her growing garden.*

**MIRA**  
I understand that feeling. Looking at my garden now, seeing these buds... I'm not afraid to hope anymore. For so long, hoping just meant more disappointment. But this... this is real.

---

### **After Level 5 Completion - "The Recipe of Life"**
**MIRA** *(garden now showing multiple blooms, her voice stronger)*  
Look at them! My roses are actually blooming! And the colors... I'd forgotten how vibrant red could be.

*She turns to the player with genuine warmth.*

**MIRA**  
The settlement feels alive again. People are helping each other, sharing stories, even laughing sometimes. When was the last time we laughed?

*She gestures toward the communal bread being shared.*

**MIRA**  
And Aldric's bread... it tastes like hope itself. Nourishing not just our bodies, but our spirits. You've given us sustenance in every sense.

---

### **After Level 6 Completion - "The Seed of Memory"**
**MIRA** *(garden flourishing, settlement vibrant with color)*  
The flower you planted... it's not just growing in the thorn garden. I can feel its influence here too. Everything is more alive, more... possible.

*She looks around at the transformed settlement.*

**MIRA**  
We're not just surviving anymore. We're living. Planning. Dreaming of tomorrow instead of just enduring today. I never thought I'd feel that again.

*She touches a particularly beautiful rose.*

**MIRA**  
Jorik would be so happy to see this. His memory lives on in that flower, and in all the life you've brought back to us.

---

### **After Level 7 Completion - Death Defeated**
**MIRA** *(garden in full bloom, settlement colorful and active)*  
You did it. You actually did it. The Pale Rider's hold on us is broken. I can feel it - we're not trapped between life and death anymore. We can truly live again.

*She looks at her thriving garden with tears of joy.*

**MIRA**  
My garden... it's more beautiful than it ever was before. And the people... look at them! They're alive, truly alive. You gave us back our lives, our hope, our future.

*She pauses, looking toward the horizon.*

**MIRA**  
I sense there are others out there, in distant places, who need what you've given us. Go to them, little light. Spread this gift. We'll be here, living and growing, thanks to you.

*She kneels by her garden, then looks up with a radiant smile.*

**MIRA**  
And I'll keep tending my garden. Not out of habit or desperation now, but out of joy. Pure joy.

**After Level 5**:
*"The roses are opening! Red, pink, white... I'd forgotten there were so many colors in the world."*

**After Level 7**:
*"Perfect blooms, each one unique and beautiful. Just like the people here - we're all flowering again."*
