# Act 1 - Character Dialogue
*The Undying Settlement*

## Main Interactive NPCs

### **Mira (The Finder)**

**Initial Discovery:**
"The roots... they remember water. I tell them every day, I tell them - water was here, water will... no. Water was here."

*[long pause, staring at grey soil]*

"Found something today. Light. Don't know why I'm... why I'm telling you this, dirt doesn't listen. But you listened once, didn't you? When the seeds were seeds and not just... not just..."

*[touches withered stem]*

"You're not supposed to be here. Nothing new comes here. I've been... I've been waiting for something new for so long I forgot I was waiting."

**Quest Dialogue - Tending the Garden:**
"The garden needs... needs something. Always needs something. Water that isn't there, soil that isn't soil anymore, seeds that remember being alive."

*[whispers to plants]*

"They're asking for help again. They always ask. I tell them I'm trying, I tell them every day I'm trying, but my hands... my hands don't know how to help anymore."

"Could you... could you find something? Something that grows? I know it sounds... I know nothing grows anymore, but maybe... maybe if we pretend hard enough..."

**After First Flower Blooms:**
"It's wrong. Flowers don't... they don't just... Look at it. LOOK at it. It's the wrong color green, it's too green, it's..."

*[whispers to flower]*

"Are you real? Are you lying to me like the dreams lie? I had a dream once where everything bloomed and then I woke up and you were still grey, still dead, still..."

"What did you do? What did you DO? I've been talking to dead things for decades and now... now something's listening back."

### **Elder Thane (Settlement Leader)**

**Initial Meeting:**
"The council was... the council was in session when the grey came. We were discussing the harvest reports, the trade agreements with the outer settlements. Important matters. Very important."

*[addresses empty air]*

"Councilor Marcus, your thoughts on the grain allocation? No? Still considering the implications, I see."

*[turns to player]*

"Forgive the interruption, citizen. We were... we were in the middle of... what were we discussing? The harvest? The harvest was good that year. Or was it poor? The records show..."

**Quest Dialogue - The Last Will:**
"My will. I wrote my will when the council... when we thought there might be... survivors need to know. Need to know where the emergency supplies were stored. Were? Are? Are stored."

"The vault beneath the old treasury. Combination was... was written down somewhere. Had to write it down because memory... because sometimes the meetings run long and you forget why you called them."

"Could you... in your capacity as... as whatever you are... could you retrieve the documents? The settlement needs to know. Needed to know. Will need to know when the council reconvenes."

**After Quest Completion:**
"You found them. The supplies. I remember now... I remember writing those orders. Emergency provisions for... for when the grey came. But it came anyway, didn't it? Came and stayed."

*[speaks in present tense for the first time]*

"Thank you. I... we... I haven't said thank you in... how long has it been since the last council meeting?"

### **Kael the Wanderer (Scout)**

**Initial Meeting:**
"Patrol report: Eastern approach clear. No movement detected. Same as yesterday's report. Same as... when was yesterday? Time marker unclear."

*[stares at horizon]*

"Been watching the same roads for... for how long now? Roads don't change. Threats don't change. Nothing changes but the watching continues because... because someone has to watch."

"You're new. New isn't... new doesn't happen here. Should report this. Should report new contact but... but who do I report to? Council's been in session for... for..."

**Quest Dialogue - The Missing Patrol:**
"Patrol team went out. Three scouts. Good scouts. Experienced. They went to check the old colosseum, the gladiator pits. That was... that was before the grey? After the grey? Time gets..."

"They never came back. Should have been back by now. Should have been back years ago. Decades ago? But the patrol schedule says they're still out there, still on mission."

"Could you... in your capacity as... as whatever authority you represent... could you check on them? Bring them home? The patrol roster needs to be... needs to be complete."

**After Quest Completion:**
"You brought them back. They were... they were fighting. Still fighting. Fighting the same battles over and over because... because that's what gladiators do."

*[updates imaginary logbook]*

"Patrol report: Team recovered. Mission status... mission status unclear. What was the mission again? Why did we send them out there?"

---

### **Vera the Swift (Guard)**

**Initial Meeting:**
"Security status: Perimeter secure. No breaches detected. Threat level remains... remains at what it was yesterday. And the day before. And..."

*[hand on weapon]*

"You're not on the authorized personnel list. Should detain you for questioning but... but the detention cells are full of... of nothing. Empty. Have been empty for..."

"The siege ended, didn't it? I remember the siege ending. Or was it beginning? Hard to tell when the walls never fall and the enemy never comes."

**Quest Dialogue - Shattered Reflections:**
"My daughter. She's in the mirror maze. Been in there since... since the mirrors started showing things that weren't there. Or were there. Are there?"

"She went in to hide from the siege. Smart girl. Always was smart. But the siege ended and she... she didn't come out. Mirrors don't let people out, do they?"

"Could you... could you go in after her? I would but... but someone has to guard the walls. Someone has to watch for the enemy that isn't coming."

**After Quest Completion:**
"You brought her back. She's... she's different. Older? Younger? Time moves strange in mirrors. Moves strange everywhere now."

*[relaxes guard stance slightly]*

"Thank you. I... I can stop watching the walls now. Can't I? The siege is over. The siege has been over for... for how long now?"

### **Sage Aldric (Keeper of Knowledge)**

**Initial Meeting:**
"Class is in session. Please take your seats. Today's lesson concerns the nature of... the nature of... what was today's lesson about?"

*[addresses empty chairs]*

"Marcus, please pay attention. Sarah, stop passing notes. Knowledge is... knowledge is what we preserve when everything else... when everything else..."

*[notices player]*

"Ah, a new student. Excellent. We were just discussing... we were... what were we discussing? The curriculum has become... unclear."

**Quest Dialogue - The Recipe of Life:**
"There's a recipe. Ancient recipe. For the bread of life. Real bread, not the... not the grey dust we pretend is nourishment."

"The ingredients are scattered. Hidden in the feast hall where the... where they eat things that aren't food. Shouldn't be food. But the recipe calls for pure ingredients, untainted by..."

"Could you... as my student... could you gather them? The recipe must be preserved. Knowledge must be... must be shared, even when there's no one left to learn."

**After Quest Completion:**
"You found them. The pure ingredients. I remember now... I remember teaching this recipe to... to students who cared about learning. Who wanted to create, not just... not just consume."

*[speaks with renewed purpose]*

"Would you like to learn? Really learn? I could teach you... I could teach you things worth knowing again."

### **Merchant Tobias (Shopkeeper)**

**Initial Meeting:**
"Welcome, welcome to Tobias's Emporium! Finest goods in the settlement! Same goods as yesterday, same prices as... as when prices meant something."

*[arranges empty shelves]*

"What can I interest you in today? We have... we have the same nothing we had yesterday. Premium nothing. Quality nothing. Been aging this nothing for decades now."

"Coins? Do you have coins? I have coins. Lots of coins. They don't buy anything but they make a nice sound when you count them. Listen..."

*[counts worthless coins]*

**Shop Dialogue:**
"Ah, a customer! A real customer! Haven't had one of those since... since customers were a thing that happened."

"What are you looking for? I have... let me see... rusty weapons that don't cut, armor that doesn't protect, potions that don't heal. Premium quality uselessness!"

"The prices are... the prices are what they were when prices mattered. Fair prices for unfair times. Or unfair prices for fair times? Market economics have become... unclear."

**After Transactions:**
"A sale! An actual sale! I should record this in the ledger. First transaction in... in how long? The books will be so pleased. The books haven't been pleased in decades."

*[makes elaborate show of recording sale]*

"Come back anytime! The shop is always open because... because where else would I go? What else would I do? Commerce is... commerce is what I am."
