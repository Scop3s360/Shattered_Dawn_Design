# Act 1 Environmental Design - Death's Domain

## The Undying Settlement (Hub)

### Central Cathedral
- Massive stone structure with Gothic architecture
- Partially collapsed roof with exposed wooden beams
- Stained glass windows cracked but still casting fractured colored light
- Main nave serves as communal gathering space
- Altar area converted into meeting space for Elder Thane

### Shanty Town
- Makeshift shelters built against cathedral's exterior walls
- Constructed from scavenged materials: wood planks, metal sheets, torn cloth
- Narrow pathways between structures create maze-like layout
- Each shelter reflects its inhabitant's former profession or personality
- Communal areas for cooking and basic crafts

### Key Locations Within Settlement
- **Mira's Garden**: Small plot in former cathedral courtyard, surrounded by cracked stone fountains
- **The Forge**: Located in cathedral's bell tower or crypt, where souls take physical form
- **Elder Thane's Council Chamber**: Repurposed chapel with broken pews arranged in council formation
- **Vera's Watch Post**: Elevated position on cathedral's remaining tower
- **Sage Aldric's Library**: Corner of cathedral nave with salvaged books and scrolls

## Surrounding Death's Domain

### The Ruined City
- Sprawling urban decay extending beyond the settlement
- Collapsed buildings create natural barriers and pathways
- Streets cracked and overgrown with grey, lifeless vegetation
- Abandoned vehicles and infrastructure tell stories of sudden catastrophe

### Bone Fields
- Areas where the dead have been improperly buried
- Uneven terrain created by mass graves and scattered remains
- Treacherous footing with hidden pitfalls
- Serves as hunting ground for undead creatures

### Grey Wastelands
- Flat, colorless expanses between major locations
- Ash-like soil that kicks up in small dust clouds
- Occasional dead trees standing like monuments
- Visibility limited by perpetual grey haze

### Ancient Monuments
- Pre-apocalypse structures now serving as quest locations
- Each reflects a different aspect of Death's corruption
- Architectural styles vary from modern to classical

## Transformation Arc

### Initial State (Pre-Hope)
- Everything rendered in shades of grey and muted browns
- Shanty town feels temporary and hopeless
- No maintenance or care visible in structures
- Oppressive atmosphere of stagnation

### Early Hope Influence
- First hints of color appear around Mira's garden
- Small repairs begin appearing on shanty structures
- Pathways become slightly more organized
- NPCs begin basic maintenance activities

### Growing Influence
- Colors spread outward from garden in visible radius
- Shanty town structures become more permanent and stable
- Cathedral's interior shows signs of cleaning and care
- Community spaces develop naturally

### Full Restoration
- Cathedral partially repaired with community effort
- Shanty town transformed into proper village
- Gardens and green spaces throughout settlement
- Warm lighting and vibrant colors replace grey desolation
