# The Fortress of Eternal War

The fortress rises from a battlefield that stretches beyond the horizon, its walls scarred by countless sieges that never end. Eighty warriors from every era of conflict fight endless battles here, their rage so pure it has consumed all memory of what they originally fought to protect. This is the Fortress of Eternal War, where combat has become the only truth anyone remembers.

The player arrives as violence erupts around them - not the desperate struggles of the other domains, but honest, brutal conflict without pretense or deception. Warriors clash with weapons from every age, their battles magnificent in their futility. The fortress echoes with the sound of steel on steel, a rhythm that has continued for generations.

This is Wrath's domain, where purgatory means eternal conflict - not the absence of peace, but the inability to remember what peace was for. The residents fight with perfect skill and unwavering determination, but they've forgotten every cause worth fighting for. They battle because battle is all they know, their rage pure but purposeless.

General Thane commands tactics for wars that have no objectives. Sergeant Kira leads charges against enemies who are also allies. Medic Gareth heals wounds only to send warriors back to meaningless combat. The Peacekeeper has forgotten that words can solve what swords cannot.

The player's presence begins changing the nature of conflict itself. Warriors start remembering what they originally fought to protect. Former enemies recognize shared values beneath their rage. The endless battles gain meaning as fighters rediscover the difference between necessary struggle and pointless violence.

The confrontation with the Red Rider comes in the Arena of Eternal Conflict, where Wrath argues that battle is the natural state, that only through struggle do people discover who they truly are. But the player demonstrates that the greatest victory is the one that makes future battles unnecessary, that true strength lies in knowing when not to fight.

With Wrath's defeat, the fortress transforms from a place of endless conflict to a center of strategic cooperation. Former enemies work together toward common goals. The residents learn that while some struggles are necessary, the purpose of fighting should always be to create a world where fighting is no longer needed.

As the player prepares for the final revelation, the fortress stands as a beacon of purposeful strength. They've discovered that courage without cause is just destruction, while righteous anger channeled toward justice can build rather than destroy. The violent purgatory of eternal conflict is replaced by the wisdom of knowing what's worth fighting for.
