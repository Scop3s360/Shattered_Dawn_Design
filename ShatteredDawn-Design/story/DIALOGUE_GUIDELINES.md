# Dialogue Guidelines for Purgatory Characters

## Core Approach
Characters in Shattered Dawn exist in various forms of purgatory - they are psychologically damaged by decades of trapped existence. Their dialogue should reflect genuine psychological fracturing rather than clean, articulate "video game NPC" speech patterns.

## Key Principles

### 1. Fractured Speech Patterns
- Let characters interrupt themselves mid-sentence
- Use repetitive phrases that show obsessive thinking
- Allow topic switches that follow damaged thought processes
- Include incomplete thoughts and trailing sentences

### 2. Time Confusion
- Mix past and present tense within the same conversation
- Reference decades-old events as if they happened yesterday
- Show confusion about how much time has actually passed
- Blur the line between memory and current reality

### 3. Conversational Partners
- Characters talk to objects, plants, or inanimate things
- Address people who aren't there (memories, ghosts, imagined companions)
- Switch between talking to the player and their usual "conversation partners"
- Show how isolation has created substitute relationships

### 4. Psychological Damage Manifestation
- Each character's damage should reflect their specific purgatory
- Death's domain: confusion between living and dying states
- Famine's domain: obsession with scarcity and measurement
- Pestilence's domain: sterile, emotionless responses
- Wrath's domain: purposeless aggression or tactical thinking

### 5. Avoid Clean Emotional Arcs
- Progress should be messy with setbacks and confusion
- Characters don't smoothly transition from broken to healed
- Show resistance to change, fear of hope, confusion about improvement
- Let them question their own perceptions and sanity

### 6. Use Silence and Pauses
- Include meaningful gaps in speech
- Show hesitation, lost thoughts, or overwhelming emotion
- Let characters struggle to find words for feelings they've forgotten
- Use pauses to show the weight of decades of isolation

## Character Development Framework

### For Each Character, Define:
1. **Specific Obsession/Routine** - What keeps them functionally trapped
2. **What They've Lost** - Memory, purpose, relationships, identity
3. **Psychological Adaptation** - How they've survived mentally
4. **Speech Damage** - How their purgatory affects communication

### Example Application (Mira):
- **Obsession**: Tending a dead garden, talking to plants
- **Lost**: Connection to living things, sense of time, hope
- **Adaptation**: Created relationships with inanimate objects
- **Speech Damage**: Addresses plants as old friends, confuses timeframes, questions her own sanity

## Practical Guidelines

### When Writing Dialogue:
- Start with how decades of their specific purgatory would realistically damage speech
- Avoid exposition dumps or clean quest instructions
- Let their psychological state drive the conversation
- Show their damage through speech patterns, not just content
- Remember: they're not just sad - they're genuinely broken in specific ways

### What to Avoid:
- Standard RPG quest-giver dialogue
- Clean emotional progression
- Articulate explanations of their situation
- Immediate trust or cooperation with the player
- Dialogue that sounds like it was written rather than spoken by a damaged mind

## Reference Example

**Standard RPG Dialogue:**
"Hello, traveler. I tend this garden, though nothing grows anymore since the curse fell. If you could help me find seeds, perhaps we could restore it."

**Purgatory-Appropriate Dialogue:**
"The roots... they remember water. I tell them every day, I tell them - water was here, water will... no. Water was here. Found something today. Light. Don't know why I'm telling you this, dirt doesn't listen. But you listened once, didn't you?"
