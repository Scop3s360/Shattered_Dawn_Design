# Act 2 Settlement - World Context
*The Dried Oasis in the Greed Ring*

## Location in the Twisted City

### Greed Ring Position
- **Ring Location**: Second ring from the outside of the spiral city
- **District Type**: Former financial and trading quarter
- **Elevation**: Moderately descended, noticeable gravitational pull toward center
- **Gravity Flow**: Stronger pull than Pride Ring, affects water flow and object placement

### Neighbourhood Context
- **Original Purpose**: Agricultural processing and commodity trading district
- **Current State**: Converted granary complex serving as survival hub
- **Surrounding Area**: Abandoned banks, trading floors, commodity exchanges
- **Connection Points**: Spiral roads from Pride Ring, pathways toward Envy Ring

## The Settlement's Place in Famine's Domain

### Famine's Path Through the City
**Route**: Greed Ring → Envy Ring → Gluttony Ring → Center
- **Starting Point**: The Dried Oasis serves as Famine's outer stronghold
- **Strategic Position**: Controls resource distribution throughout Famine's domain
- **Symbolic Role**: Represents hoarding and scarcity in a place once abundant

### Environmental Integration
- **Granary Complex**: Industrial structures adapted to the ring's curved layout
- **Silo Adaptation**: Cylindrical buildings follow the ring's gravitational flow
- **Dried Fountain**: Central feature positioned at the ring's optimal water collection point
- **Trading Infrastructure**: Utilizes the ring's former commercial transportation networks

## The Greed Ring's Characteristics

### Physical Environment
- **Architecture**: Financial buildings, trading centers, commodity warehouses
- **Condition**: Structures show resource stripping and desperate modification
- **Gravity Effects**: Noticeable pull causes water to flow in spirals, objects slide toward center
- **Atmosphere**: Harsh desert conditions with scarcity-focused modifications

### Thematic Elements
- **Greed Manifestations**: Empty vaults, stripped buildings, hoarding behaviors
- **Famine's Influence**: Abundance turned to scarcity, wealth meaningless without resources
- **Corruption Style**: Desperate accumulation of worthless materials
- **Hope's Impact**: Sharing replaces hoarding, abundance returns through cooperation

## Settlement Integration with City Structure

### Transportation Links
- **Inward Path**: Spiral road leading to Envy Ring for Famine's quest progression
- **Outward Connection**: Route back to Pride Ring and other outer settlements
- **Underground Networks**: Former financial district's secure transport tunnels
- **Elevated Platforms**: Trading floor overpasses adapted for settlement navigation

### Resource Context
- **Scavenging Areas**: Stripped financial buildings and abandoned trading centers
- **Water Sources**: Broken financial district fountains and decorative water features
- **Materials**: Metal from bank vaults, stone from trading buildings
- **Strategic Value**: Central position for resource distribution and trade

## Transformation Within the Spiral

### Initial State (Frozen Descent)
- Settlement exists in resource-scarce survival mode within the Greed Ring
- Granary complex repurposed for desperate resource management
- NPCs trapped in hoarding behaviors that reflect the ring's greedy corruption
- Environment shows wealth and abundance turned to desperate scarcity

### Hope's Influence on the Ring
- **Local Effects**: Settlement begins showing signs of abundance and sharing
- **Ring-Wide Impact**: Other Greed Ring locations start showing resource improvement
- **Gravitational Changes**: Water begins flowing more naturally, less chaotic spiral
- **Architectural Healing**: Financial buildings show signs of community repurposing

### Connection to Famine's Defeat
- **Settlement Victory**: Dried Oasis becomes thriving trade hub
- **Ring Liberation**: Greed Ring transforms from hoarding to healthy commerce
- **Path Opening**: Route to Envy Ring becomes accessible for continued journey
- **Symbolic Completion**: Famine's hold on scarcity and want is broken

## Visual Identity Within the Spiral City

### Distinctive Features
- **Silo Skyline**: Cylindrical storage structures creating unique silhouette
- **Fountain Centerpiece**: Dried fountain as focal point of the ring's curve
- **Industrial Adaptation**: Granary machinery repurposed for community use
- **Desert Aesthetic**: Harsh, sun-bleached environment contrasting with inner rings

### Relationship to Other Settlements
- **Elevation Difference**: Noticeably lower than Pride Ring, higher than inner settlements
- **Architectural Contrast**: Industrial and commercial vs. other settlements' themes
- **Resource Hub**: Central position makes it natural trading point between settlements
- **Transformation Scale**: Shows progression from individual survival to community prosperity

## Ring-Specific Challenges

### Gravitational Effects
- **Water Management**: Spiral flow patterns require adapted collection systems
- **Structural Adaptation**: Buildings modified to account for increased center-pull
- **Transportation**: Movement requires understanding of the ring's gravitational currents
- **Resource Distribution**: Gravity affects how materials and supplies are stored and moved

### Environmental Hazards
- **Desert Conditions**: Harsh climate exacerbated by the ring's position
- **Scarcity Pressure**: Constant struggle for resources affects all decisions
- **Structural Instability**: Buildings show stress from gravitational distortion
- **Social Tension**: Competition for resources creates community challenges
