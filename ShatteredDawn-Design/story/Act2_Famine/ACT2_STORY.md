# The Dried Oasis

The desert stretches endlessly in all directions, a wasteland where scarcity rules and water is more precious than gold. At its heart lies the Dried Oasis - a settlement built around a magnificent fountain that hasn't flowed in generations. Thirty survivors cling to life here, rationing drops of water and scraps of food with desperate precision.

The player arrives as a stranger carrying impossible abundance. Where they walk, water tastes sweeter and food lasts longer. The settlement watches with cautious hope as their visitor examines the cracked fountain at the town's center, its ornate stonework a reminder of better times.

This is Famine's domain, where purgatory means eternal want - never starving enough to die, never fed enough to thrive. The residents have learned to share what little they have, but sharing nothing still leaves everyone with nothing. They measure their lives in careful sips and counted crumbs.

Hadim the Trader haggles over prices that mean survival or death. Elder Yasmin tells stories of abundance that feel like fairy tales. Healer Amara tends patients who recover just enough to continue suffering. Scout Khalil maps routes to resources that never last long enough.

The player's presence begins changing the fundamental nature of scarcity itself. Each act of generosity multiplies rather than diminishes. Water sources become reliable. Food becomes nourishing. The careful rationing gives way to cautious sharing, then to genuine abundance.

The confrontation with the Black Rider comes at the Heart of Want - a crater where plenty once flowed freely. Famine argues that only through scarcity do people learn to value what they have, that abundance breeds waste and ingratitude. But the player demonstrates that sharing creates more than hoarding ever could.

With Famine's defeat, the fountain springs to life with crystal-clear water. Gardens bloom in the desert sand. The settlement transforms from a place of careful survival to a thriving hub of trade and community. The residents learn that true wealth comes not from having more, but from sharing what you have.

As the player departs for the plague lands, the Dried Oasis has become a beacon of prosperity in the wasteland. They've discovered that abundance shared multiplies, while scarcity hoarded only grows. The desert purgatory of eternal want is replaced by the joy of plenty freely given.
