# Act 2 Character List

## Main Interactive NPCs

**Hadim the Trader**
He negotiates prices with desperate precision, knowing that every transaction could mean the difference between life and death for his customers. Hadim's scales measure portions so small they barely sustain life, yet he treats each grain of rice like precious metal. He continues trading because commerce gives structure to survival, even when there's barely anything left to exchange. The act of negotiation maintains hope that tomorrow might bring better deals and fuller bellies.

**Elder Yasmin (Keeper of Stories)**
She tells tales of the time before the great drought, when the oasis flowed freely and markets overflowed with goods. Yasmin's stories paint pictures of abundance so vivid they feel like dreams, keeping alive memories of what prosperity once looked like. She continues storytelling because the past holds lessons for survival, even when those lessons feel impossible to apply. The act of remembering maintains connection to hope that such times might return.

**Healer Amara**
She tends patients with medicines stretched so thin they barely work, watching people recover just enough to continue their slow decline. Amara's treatments focus on keeping people functional rather than truly healthy, managing symptoms of starvation and dehydration. She continues healing because life has value even in suffering, even when her remedies only delay the inevitable. The act of caring maintains her humanity in a world where compassion feels like luxury.

**Scout Khalil**
He maps routes to water sources and food caches that disappear as quickly as they're found, his knowledge constantly outdated by the desert's harsh reality. Khalil's reports detail resources that might last days or hours, never long enough to provide real security. He continues scouting because information means survival, even when that information changes faster than it can be shared. The act of exploration maintains hope that the next discovery might be the one that saves everyone.

**Water Keeper Farid**
He guards the settlement's precious water reserves with his life, measuring each drop with religious precision. Farid's ledgers track every sip consumed and every drop collected, his records more valuable than gold. He continues his vigil because water is life itself, even when there's never enough to go around. The responsibility of rationing gives his existence meaning in a world where waste equals death.

**Food Distributor Zara**
She divides meager rations with mathematical precision, ensuring everyone gets exactly their fair share of almost nothing. Zara's portions are so carefully measured that she knows the weight of individual grains, her scales the most important tool in the settlement. She continues distribution because fairness matters even in scarcity, even when fair shares still leave everyone hungry. The act of equal division maintains social order in a world where inequality means death.

## Background NPCs

**The Well Digger (Rashid)**
He digs new wells with tireless determination, always hoping the next hole will strike water that lasts more than a few days. Rashid's hands are permanently stained with sand and stone, his tools worn smooth from constant use. He continues digging because water might be just one more foot down, even when every previous attempt has failed. The rhythm of excavation gives structure to his days in a world where hope runs as dry as the wells.

**Caravan Master Salim**
He organizes trading expeditions to distant settlements, bartering their few goods for slightly different forms of scarcity. Salim's caravans return with new types of rationed supplies, trading desert sand for mountain dust. He continues organizing because movement feels like progress, even when every destination offers the same desperate shortages. The act of planning journeys maintains hope that somewhere abundance still exists.

**Grain Counter Layla**
She catalogs every seed and kernel in the settlement's stores, her counts more precise than any merchant's inventory. Layla's records track consumption down to individual grains, her mathematics the difference between lasting another week or starving tomorrow. She continues counting because precision means survival, even when the numbers always add up to not enough. The act of measurement gives control in a world where scarcity controls everything.

**Desert Forager Malik**
He searches the wasteland for edible plants and insects, bringing back handfuls of sustenance that disappear in minutes. Malik's knowledge of desert survival keeps the settlement alive one meal at a time, his finds celebrated like treasure. He continues foraging because the desert might hide one more source of food, even when each day's search yields less than the last. The act of hunting maintains hope that nature still provides for those who know where to look.

**Rain Watcher Amina**
She studies the sky for signs of storms that never come, her predictions based on cloud patterns that promise water but deliver only dust. Amina's weather lore speaks of seasonal rains that stopped falling generations ago, her forecasts always optimistic despite constant disappointment. She continues watching because the next cloud might be different, even when the sky remains endlessly clear. The act of observation maintains faith that the natural cycle will eventually return.

**Memory Keeper Yusuf**
He maintains detailed records of what the oasis was like before the drought, his writings preserving knowledge of abundance for future generations. Yusuf's chronicles describe irrigation systems and farming techniques that worked when water flowed freely. He continues writing because the past holds blueprints for the future, even when that future seems impossible to reach. The act of documentation maintains connection to better times that might someday return.
