# Act 2 Environmental Design - Famine's Domain

## The Dried Oasis (Granary Complex Hub)

### Main Processing Building
- Massive industrial structure with high ceilings and concrete walls
- Central area converted into community gathering space
- Loading docks repurposed as trading platforms for Hadim's market
- Administrative offices converted into individual living quarters
- Conveyor systems and machinery stand silent and rusted

### The Silos
- Towering cylindrical storage structures converted into multi-level homes
- Each silo houses 3-4 families with makeshift floors and partitions
- External ladders and walkways connect silos at different levels
- Top levels used for lookout posts and water collection
- Bottom levels serve as workshops and storage

### The Dried Fountain
- Ornate centerpiece in the main courtyard between silos
- Once fed by underground springs, now cracked and empty
- Intricate stonework shows what abundance once looked like
- Becomes focal point for Hope's transformation of the settlement
- Surrounded by carefully maintained but barren garden plots

### Key Locations Within Settlement
- **Hadim's Trading Post**: Set up in former grain weighing station
- **Elder Yasmin's Story Circle**: Shaded area between silos with salvaged seating
- **Healer Amara's Clinic**: Converted office space with medical supplies
- **Scout Khalil's Map Room**: Elevated position in tallest silo
- **Water Keeper Farid's Reserves**: Secured underground storage chambers
- **Food Distribution Center**: Former loading bay with Zara's precise scales

## Surrounding Famine's Domain

### The Great Desert
- Endless expanse of sand dunes and rocky outcroppings
- Scattered ruins of agricultural settlements buried in sand
- Ancient irrigation channels now filled with dust
- Mirages that promise water but deliver only disappointment

### Dried Riverbeds
- Deep channels carved by rivers that no longer flow
- Exposed bedrock shows mineral deposits and fossil remains
- Occasional pools of stagnant, undrinkable water
- Natural highways for travel but also ambush points

### Abandoned Farmlands
- Vast fields of cracked earth stretching to horizon
- Skeletal remains of farm equipment half-buried in sand
- Dried wells with broken windmills standing as monuments
- Occasional oasis that proves to be temporary or poisoned

### Resource Outposts
- Small camps built around temporary water sources
- Fortified positions for controlling access to scarce resources
- Trading posts along caravan routes
- Mining operations seeking underground water

## Transformation Arc

### Initial State (Pre-Hope)
- Everything rendered in harsh desert tones - browns, tans, bleached whites
- Granary complex feels like a fortress against scarcity
- Strict rationing visible in every aspect of daily life
- Atmosphere of careful survival and measured desperation

### Early Hope Influence
- First drops of water appear in the fountain's basin
- Small improvements in food quality and quantity
- Trading becomes slightly less desperate, more hopeful
- Community spaces show signs of social gathering

### Growing Influence
- Fountain begins to trickle with clear water
- Green shoots appear in garden plots around the complex
- Silos show improvements and decorative touches
- Market activity increases with better goods available

### Full Restoration
- Fountain flows freely with crystal-clear water
- Lush gardens bloom throughout the complex
- Granary becomes thriving trade hub
- Desert around settlement shows signs of returning fertility
- Community transforms from survival mode to prosperity
