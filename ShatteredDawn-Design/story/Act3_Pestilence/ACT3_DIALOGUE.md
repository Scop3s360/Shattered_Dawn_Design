## Main Interactive NPCs

**Initial Meeting:**
"Patient intake protocol initiated. Please state your symptoms for... for diagnostic evaluation. Though you appear to be experiencing... experiencing what we have successfully eliminated here."

*[examines clipboard with perfect handwriting]*

"Emotional fluctuations detected. Irregular breathing patterns. Signs of... of what patients used to call 'feeling.' This is treatable. This is curable. We have perfected the cure."

*[speaks to clipboard as if it responds]*

"Chart indicates optimal treatment pathway. Standard emotional removal procedure. Success rate: one hundred percent. Patient satisfaction: not applicable, as satisfaction is... is an emotional response we have eliminated."

**Quest Dialogue - Perfect Treatment:**
"The treatment protocols require... require specific components. Pure components. Untainted by the chaos of... of natural emotion."

"There are supplies in the old wing. The wing where we... where we used to treat patients instead of curing them. Before we understood that treatment prolongs suffering while... while curing eliminates it entirely."

*[adjusts perfect medical instruments]*

"Could you retrieve them? The final components for... for universal treatment? Soon everyone can be... can be as perfectly empty as we are here."

**After Quest Completion:**
"Excellent. The components are... are pristine. Uncontaminated by feeling. Now we can... can extend our perfect treatment to... to everyone who still suffers from the disease of emotion."

*[prepares treatment with clinical precision]*

### **Patient Zero (Marcus)**

**Initial Meeting:**
"Good morning. It is morning, is it not? Time has become... uniform. Each moment identical to the last. This is... this is peaceful."

*[sits with perfect posture, hands folded]*

"I used to experience what they called emotions. Messy things. Unpredictable things. The doctors removed them. Now I am... I am optimal. Functioning at peak efficiency without the interference of... of feeling."

"Do you feel things? How... how exhausting that must be. All that chaos, all that... that variation. I remember variation. I remember when each day felt different from the last."

**Quest Dialogue - Perfect Memory:**
"I remember everything now. Every emotion I used to have. The doctors preserved the memories while... while removing the capacity to feel them. This is... this is optimal data storage."

"There are others like me. The first patients. The successful ones. They are in the memory ward, cataloging their... their former emotional states for research purposes."

*[stares with empty contentment]*

"Could you visit them? Could you document their... their perfect emptiness? The research must continue. The treatment must be... must be refined for maximum efficiency."

**After Quest Completion:**
"You have seen them. The perfectly treated. We are... we are the future of humanity. Humanity without the burden of... of being human."

*[processes information without emotion]*

"This data will help perfect the treatment. Perfect the perfection. Make the emptiness more... more complete. Though completeness implies satisfaction, and satisfaction is... is no longer applicable."

### **Nurse Lydia**

**Initial Meeting:**
"Shift report: all patients stable. Stable meaning... meaning unchanged. Unchanging. They never change because... because change requires feeling, and feeling has been... has been medically contraindicated."

*[checks charts mechanically]*

"I assist with treatments. Perfect treatments. Treatments that work by... by removing the need for treatment. This is... this is efficient medicine."

"Sometimes I wonder if... if we are helping. But wondering is... is a form of concern, and concern is an emotion. Emotions are... are the disease we treat."

**Quest Dialogue - Questioning Protocol:**
"The treatment protocols... they are perfect. Too perfect. Perfect in a way that... that feels wrong. But feeling wrong is... is itself wrong, is it not?"

"There are old medical texts. Hidden texts. From when medicine... when medicine tried to heal instead of... instead of eliminate. Could you... could you find them?"

*[glances around nervously, then stops being nervous]*

"I should not feel curious about this. Curiosity is... is an emotional response. But the protocols say... say to investigate anomalies. You are... you are an anomaly."

**After Quest Completion:**
"You found them. The old texts. They speak of... of healing that preserves humanity instead of... instead of removing it. This is... this is confusing. Confusion is... is not optimal."

*[struggles with conflicting programming]*

"The texts suggest our treatment is... is wrong. But wrong implies judgment, and judgment requires... requires feeling. I am not supposed to... to feel anything about this."

*[tends identical flowers with mechanical precision]*

"Each plant identical. Each bloom... each bloom precisely measured. Beauty achieved through... through elimination of natural chaos. This is... this is perfect horticulture."

"You observe the gardens? Observation is... is permitted. Emotional response to beauty is... is not permitted. Beauty serves function, not... not feeling."

**Quest Dialogue - Natural Growth:**
"Anomaly detected in greenhouse sector seven. Plants showing... showing unauthorized variation. Growth patterns deviating from... from prescribed parameters."

"Natural seeds have contaminated... contaminated the sterile growing medium. Seeds that remember... remember chaos. Remember wild growth instead of... instead of controlled perfection."

"Could you remove the contamination? Could you restore... restore perfect uniformity? The garden requires... requires absolute control over... over natural impulses."

**After Quest Completion:**
"Contamination removed. Garden restored to... to optimal parameters. Though the wild seeds showed... showed interesting growth patterns. Patterns not... not in the approved botanical database."

*[stares at perfectly uniform garden]*

"Sometimes I wonder... wonder what gardens looked like before... before we perfected them. But wondering is... is not in my job description."

"But therapy sessions continue. Continue because... because protocols require ongoing... ongoing maintenance of achieved emptiness."

*[reviews files of perfectly empty patients]*

"Could you observe therapy sessions? Could you document... document the perfect absence of... of therapeutic need? Research requires... requires data on successful... successful emotional elimination."

*Note: All dialogue maintains the clinical, emotionally sterilized speech patterns of Pestilence's domain. Characters speak about the absence of emotion as medical success, showing the horror of "healing" that removes humanity itself.*
