# Act 3 Environmental Design - Pestilence's Domain

## The Sanitarium (Hospital Complex Hub)

### Main Hospital Building
- Gleaming white corridors with sterile fluorescent lighting
- Patient rooms with identical layouts and furnishings
- Everything appears pristine but feels unnaturally perfect
- No wear, no stains, no signs of actual use or life
- Antiseptic smell permeates every space

### Medical Wings
- **Surgery Wing**: Operating theaters with equipment that's too clean, too perfect
- **Patient Wards**: Rows of beds with occupants who never move or complain
- **Psychiatric Wing**: Padded rooms and therapy spaces for "emotional disorders"
- **Laboratory Complex**: Research facilities studying the elimination of human flaws
- **Administrative Wing**: Offices managing the perfect system

### The Purification Chamber
- Central facility where Dr. Seraphina performs her "treatments"
- Gleaming white chamber with medical equipment of unknown purpose
- Viewing galleries for observing procedures
- Connected to all wings via sterile corridors
- The heart of the facility's false perfection

### Key Locations Within Sanitarium
- **Dr. Seraphina's Office**: Immaculate space with no personal touches
- **Patient Zero's Room**: The "perfect" patient's sterile living space
- **Nurse Lydia's Station**: Medical supply area showing cracks in the system
- **The Gardener's Greenhouse**: Artificially perfect plants in controlled environment
- **Therapy Rooms**: Spaces for "correcting" emotional responses
- **Staff Quarters**: Living spaces as sterile as the medical areas

## Surrounding Pestilence's Domain

### The Sterile Grounds
- Perfectly manicured lawns with identical grass height
- Geometric garden beds with flowers in precise arrangements
- Walking paths that form perfect patterns when viewed from above
- Benches placed at mathematically optimal intervals

### Quarantine Zones
- Areas where "imperfect" elements are contained
- Fenced sections showing what natural growth looks like
- Contrast zones that highlight the facility's artificial nature
- Buffer areas between the sanitarium and the outside world

### Research Outposts
- Smaller facilities conducting experiments in perfection
- Field stations studying natural "contamination"
- Observation posts monitoring for signs of emotional outbreak
- Testing grounds for new purification techniques

### The Outer Wasteland
- Areas beyond the sanitarium's influence
- Natural decay and chaos that the facility fights against
- Abandoned settlements that refused "treatment"
- Wild growth and uncontrolled life

## Transformation Arc

### Initial State (Pre-Hope)
- Everything rendered in clinical whites and sterile blues
- Perfect but lifeless environment
- No variation, no personality, no genuine warmth
- Atmosphere of oppressive cleanliness and false peace

### Early Hope Influence
- First signs of imperfection appear - scuff marks, slight discoloration
- Patients show micro-expressions and tiny gestures
- Small variations appear in the perfect patterns
- Staff begin to question procedures subtly

### Growing Influence
- Colors begin to appear - warm tones creeping into the sterile palette
- Patients start showing genuine emotions and reactions
- Gardens become less geometric, more naturally beautiful
- Personal touches appear in rooms and spaces

### Full Restoration
- Hospital transforms from sterile facility to genuine healing center
- Vibrant colors and natural lighting replace harsh fluorescents
- Patients engage in real activities and relationships
- Gardens bloom with wild, natural beauty
- Facility serves actual healing rather than emotional elimination
- Messy, beautiful humanity replaces sterile perfection
