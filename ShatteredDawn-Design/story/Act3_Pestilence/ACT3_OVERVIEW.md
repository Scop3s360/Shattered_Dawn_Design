*Levels 15-21: The Realm of False Purity*

## **ü¶† Act Overview**
After bringing abundance to Famine's desert, Hope enters Pestilence's Domain - a realm of deceptive beauty where everything appears pure and clean, but nothing truly lives. This act explores themes of corruption disguised as salvation, the difference between sterility and purity, and the psychological manipulation of false hope.

**Patient Zero's Warning**: *"The anger... I can feel it from here, even through my newfound emotions. It's not like the others - not cold like Death, not desperate like Famine, not seductive like Pestilence. It's... honest. Purely, terrifyingly honest. Be careful, Hope. Sometimes the most dangerous enemy is the one who doesn't lie about what they are."*
