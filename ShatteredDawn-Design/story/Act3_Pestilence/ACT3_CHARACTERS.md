She maintains the Sanitarium's perfect treatments with unwavering dedication, believing she has eliminated all forms of human suffering. Seraphina's procedures remove not just pain but every emotion that might cause discomfort, leaving patients in blissful emptiness. She continues her work because she genuinely believes suffering is a disease that must be cured. The act of healing gives her purpose, even when her cures remove what makes patients human.

**Patient Zero (Marcus)**
He exists in perfect contentment, the first and most successful recipient of the Sanitarium's complete emotional purification. Marcus feels no pain, no fear, no sadness, but also no joy, no love, no genuine satisfaction. He remains because this state feels peaceful compared to the chaos of human emotion. The absence of feeling has become his definition of health, even though it's indistinguishable from death.

**Nurse Lydia**
She assists with treatments while beginning to question whether their perfect procedures truly help the patients. Lydia notices small signs that suggest the patients might be missing something important, though she can't quite identify what. She continues working because helping people was her calling, even when she's not sure their help is actually helpful. The act of caring maintains her humanity in a system designed to eliminate it.

**The Gardener (Elena)**
She maintains landscapes so perfect they look artificial, every plant precisely placed and every flower identical in size and color. Elena's gardens lack the wild beauty of natural growth, instead displaying the sterile perfection of complete control.

The act of cultivation gives structure to her existence in a world where natural growth has been eliminated.

The act of organizing gives meaning to his role in a system where free will has been medically removed.

**Therapist Dr. Cain**
He conducts sessions where patients discuss their complete lack of problems, their conversations as empty as their emotional states. Cain's therapy focuses on maintaining the perfect mental balance achieved through emotional removal rather than working through actual issues.

**Laboratory Technician Iris**
She runs tests to measure the complete absence of emotional markers in patient blood samples, her results always showing perfect emptiness. Iris's data confirms the success of treatments by documenting what's no longer there rather than what remains.

The act of analysis gives structure to her work in a world where the most important things can't be measured.

**Physical Therapist Marcus**
He guides patients through exercises designed to maintain bodily function without any sense of physical accomplishment or satisfaction. Marcus's routines keep bodies healthy while ensuring no endorphins or natural pleasure responses interfere with emotional emptiness.

The act of movement gives purpose to his role in a system where the body is maintained but the spirit is eliminated.

**Nutritionist Clara**
She designs meal plans that provide perfect nutrition while ensuring food brings no pleasure or satisfaction to those who consume it. Clara's menus meet every dietary requirement while carefully avoiding any flavors that might trigger emotional responses.

**Patient Seven (Sarah)**
She follows her daily routine with perfect compliance, her face showing the same serene emptiness as every other successfully treated resident.

The act of purifying gives structure to his days in a world where contamination has been eliminated along with life itself.

**Records Keeper Dorothy**
She maintains files documenting the complete absence of patient problems, her paperwork recording successful treatments by noting what symptoms no longer exist.
