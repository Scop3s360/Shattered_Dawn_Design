## **Domain Atmosphere**
The Poisoned Well reeks of contaminated water and spoiled grain. The ground is cracked and barren, stained with the residue of spite and sabotage. Every surface bears the marks of deliberate destruction, and the air itself tastes bitter with resentment. Nothing grows here except hatred, and even the shadows seem to wither what they touch.
