# Famine's Domain - Sloth Enemies
*The Withered Fields*

---

## **4 Basic Enemies (Normal)**

### **Neglect Wraith**
**Classification:** Normal Enemy
**Description:** Ghostly figures of farmers who abandoned their crops to rot. They appear as translucent shapes carrying rusted tools, forever too late to save what they let die.
**Behavior:** Moves with extreme reluctance, attacks half-heartedly with broken farming tools, occasionally stops moving entirely as if forgetting what they were doing.

### **Apathy Phantom**
**Classification:** Normal Enemy  
**Description:** Spirits of those who starved because they couldn't be bothered to seek food. They drift aimlessly through barren fields, emanating waves of crushing indifference.
**Behavior:** Drains motivation and energy from everything nearby, attacks by spreading lethargy and despair, becomes more solid when others show initiative or effort.

### **Lazy Shade**
**Classification:** Normal Enemy
**Description:** Hollow beings that exist in a state of eternal procrastination. They carry half-finished tasks and abandoned projects, always about to act but never quite managing it.
**Behavior:** Starts actions but rarely completes them, gets distracted mid-combat, occasionally helps enemies through sheer incompetence and misdirection.

### **Withered Scarecrow**
**Classification:** Normal Enemy
**Description:** Animated guardians of dead fields, too lazy to protect the crops they were meant to watch. Their straw stuffing has rotted, and crows nest in their hollow frames.
**Behavior:** Stands motionless until directly threatened, attacks with slow, predictable movements, occasionally falls apart from neglect mid-combat.

## **3 Medium Enemies (Forced Corrupted - Redeemable)**

### **Corrupted Farmer**
**Classification:** Forced Corrupted (Redeemable)
**Description:** An agricultural worker twisted by Famine's influence into neglecting the very crops they once lovingly tended. Their hands shake as they're forced to let plants die.
**Behavior:** Mechanically destroys crops while clearly wanting to nurture them, shows visible distress at being prevented from proper farming, sometimes "accidentally" tends to plants.

### **Enslaved Gardener**
**Classification:** Forced Corrupted (Redeemable)
**Description:** A caretaker corrupted into abandoning their duties while everything around them withers. They weep as they watch gardens die under their forced neglect.
**Behavior:** Performs maintenance tasks incorrectly or incompletely, shows obvious frustration at their inability to properly care for plants, occasionally manages to help something grow.

### **Bound Shepherd**
**Classification:** Forced Corrupted (Redeemable)
**Description:** A livestock guardian enslaved to neglect their flocks while predators circle. Their protective instincts war with their imposed apathy.
**Behavior:** Watches helplessly as threats approach their charges, shows clear anguish at their inability to protect, sometimes breaks free to defend the innocent.

## **2 Hard Enemies (Sin Embracers - Irredeemable)**

### **Sloth the Harvest-Killer**
**Classification:** Sin Embracer (Sloth) - Irredeemable
**Description:** A legendary farmer who chose to let his fields die rather than put in the effort to maintain them. His body has merged with a rotting plow, and weeds grow through his flesh.
**Special Ability:** **"Spreading Neglect"** - Can cause crops to wither, tools to rust, and motivation to drain from entire areas, making productive work impossible.
**Behavior:** Refuses to move from his resting place among dead crops, attacks through waves of lethargy and despair, speaks of the futility of all effort.

### **Lady Acedia the Field-Abandoner**
**Classification:** Sin Embracer (Sloth) - Irredeemable  
**Description:** A landowner who embraced the collapse of agriculture rather than manage her estates. She sits on a throne of rotting grain, surrounded by the tools she refused to use.
**Special Ability:** **"Temporal Stagnation"** - Can trap enemies in loops where they begin tasks but never complete them, or slow time itself in areas to make progress impossible.
**Behavior:** Constantly postpones any action, makes elaborate plans she never executes, becomes annoyed when forced to actually do anything productive.

## **1 Boss Enemy**

### **Ceres the Barren Mother** 
**Classification:** Domain Boss (Sloth Lieutenant of Famine)
**Description:** The goddess of harvest corrupted into Famine's mistress of agricultural neglect. Her massive form sits among endless fields of rotted crops, and her touch turns fertile soil to dust. She is surrounded by rusted farming tools and abandoned irrigation systems that she refuses to maintain.
**Behavior:** Commands through promises of rest and freedom from the burden of cultivation, speaks slowly of the futility of fighting against natural decay, treats agricultural collapse as inevitable.
**Philosophy:** Believes that all effort to sustain life is ultimately meaningless and that entropy always wins. Sees Famine's domain as proof that it's easier to let everything die than to struggle against the natural order.

## **Domain Atmosphere**
The Withered Fields stretch endlessly under a gray sky, filled with the remnants of abandoned agriculture. Broken plows rust in furrows that will never be completed, and irrigation channels have cracked and dried. The air smells of rotting grain and missed opportunities, while the sound of wind through dead stalks creates a constant whisper of regret and neglect.
