### **Mammon the Grain-Hoarder**

## **1 Boss Enemy**

### **Croesus the Vault-Heart** 
**Classification:** Domain Boss (Greed Lieutenant of Famine)
**Description:** The richest man who ever lived, now Famine's treasurer of want. His massive form is built from empty vaults and barren storehouses. Golden chains bind his limbs, but they secure nothing, and his heart is a massive empty safe that echoes with hollow promises.

## **Domain Atmosphere**
The Empty Granary stretches endlessly with towering silos that contain only dust and broken dreams. The air tastes of copper coins and empty promises, while the sound of rattling chains echoes through chambers where wealth once flowed. Every surface bears the marks of desperate clawing, and scales hang broken and useless, unable to weigh what no longer exists.
