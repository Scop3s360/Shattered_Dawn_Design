*The Starving Palace*

---

## **4 Basic Enemies (Normal)**

### **Withered Courtier**
**Classification:** Normal Enemy
**Description:** Emaciated nobles who refuse to acknowledge their starvation, still wearing tattered finery that hangs loose on their skeletal frames. They maintain perfect posture despite their weakness.
**Behavior:** Moves with forced dignity despite obvious hunger, attacks with ceremonial weapons that are too heavy for their weakened state, occasionally faints from malnutrition.

### **Hunger Herald**
**Classification:** Normal Enemy  
**Description:** Gaunt messengers who proclaim the greatness of their starving lords. Their voices crack from thirst, but they continue their announcements with desperate pride.
**Behavior:** Shouts proclamations that drain their own energy, attacks with scrolls and ceremonial horns, becomes weaker with each proclamation but refuses to stop.

### **Desiccated Noble**
**Classification:** Normal Enemy
**Description:** Mummified aristocrats preserved by their own arrogance rather than proper embalming. Their dried skin stretches tight over prominent bones, yet they still demand respect.
**Behavior:** Commands non-existent servants, attacks with jeweled but brittle weapons, leaves trails of dust and the scent of ancient perfumes mixed with decay.

### **Starved Scribe**
**Classification:** Normal Enemy
**Description:** Skeletal record-keepers who continue documenting the "achievements" of their dying realm. Their ink has long since dried, but they scratch meaningless marks with bone quills.
**Behavior:** Attempts to "document" the battle while fighting, throws dried scrolls and bone fragments, occasionally stops to make notes in the air.

## **3 Medium Enemies (Forced Corrupted - Redeemable)**

### **Corrupted Steward**
**Classification:** Forced Corrupted (Redeemable)
**Description:** A palace administrator twisted by Famine's influence into hoarding the last scraps of food from the starving. Their ledgers are stained with tears of guilt.
**Behavior:** Mechanically guards food stores while clearly wanting to distribute them, shows visible distress when preventing others from eating, sometimes "accidentally" drops supplies.

### **Enslaved Butler**
**Classification:** Forced Corrupted (Redeemable)
**Description:** A loyal servant corrupted into maintaining the facade of plenty while everyone starves. They serve empty plates with perfect etiquette, weeping at the mockery of hospitality.
**Behavior:** Performs elaborate serving rituals with nothing to serve, shows clear anguish at their inability to provide real sustenance, sometimes offers genuine help despite their condition.

### **Bound Treasurer**
**Classification:** Forced Corrupted (Redeemable)
**Description:** A financial officer enslaved to count worthless coins while people die of hunger. Their hands shake as they're forced to value gold over grain.

## **2 Hard Enemies (Sin Embracers - Irredeemable)**

### **Lord Vainglory the Famished**
**Classification:** Sin Embracer (Pride) - Irredeemable
**Description:** A king who chose to starve his entire kingdom rather than admit his failures. His crown has grown into his skull, and his royal robes are sewn from the hair of his starved subjects.
**Special Ability:** **"Royal Decree"** - Can command the environment itself to deny sustenance to enemies, causing food to rot and water to evaporate in his presence.
**Behavior:** Issues grandiose proclamations about his magnificence while visibly starving, refuses all offers of food or aid, becomes enraged when his authority is questioned.

### **Duchess Superbia the Untouchable**
**Classification:** Sin Embracer (Pride) - Irredeemable  
**Description:** A noblewoman who maintained her "perfect" appearance by consuming the beauty of others. Her face is a mask of stolen features, and mirrors around her show only empty frames.
**Special Ability:** **"Consuming Vanity"** - Can drain the strength, beauty, and vitality from enemies to temporarily restore her own appearance, growing more powerful as others weaken.
**Behavior:** Obsessively maintains her appearance even while starving, steals anything that might enhance her beauty, shatters mirrors that show her true condition.

## **1 Boss Enemy**

### **Ozymandias the Hollow Crown** 
**Classification:** Domain Boss (Pride Lieutenant of Famine)
**Description:** The greatest emperor who ever ruled, now Famine's most devoted servant. His massive throne is built from the bones of his starved subjects, and his crown weighs more than his emaciated body can support. Empty granaries stretch behind him like a monument to his pride.
**Behavior:** Rules over an empire of dust and bones, speaks of his eternal greatness while surrounded by the evidence of his failures, treats starvation as a test of loyalty to his reign.
**Philosophy:** Believes that true nobility means never admitting need or weakness. Sees Famine's domain as the ultimate test of aristocratic endurance where only the truly superior survive.

## **Domain Atmosphere**
The Starving Palace echoes with the hollow grandeur of empty halls and vacant thrones. Golden fixtures tarnish in the dry air, and elaborate tapestries depict feasts that no one remembers. The scent of ancient spices cannot mask the underlying smell of slow starvation, and every surface bears the dust of a realm that forgot how to sustain itself.
