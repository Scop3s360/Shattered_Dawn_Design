## **Domain Atmosphere**
The Last Feast is set with infinite tables bearing elaborate place settings for meals that will never come. The air is thick with the aroma of phantom delicacies that turn to ash when breathed, and the sound of clinking silverware echoes through halls where no food has been served for eons. Every surface bears the stains of spilled wine that was never poured and crumbs from bread that was never baked.
