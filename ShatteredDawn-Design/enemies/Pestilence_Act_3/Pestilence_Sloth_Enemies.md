## **Domain Atmosphere**
The Neglected Hospital hums with the sound of perfectly maintained equipment monitoring nothing meaningful. The air smells of antiseptic mixed with the absence of purpose, while the lighting is the dim glow of machines that function flawlessly while accomplishing nothing. Every surface is spotlessly clean but serves no function, and the silence is broken only by the beeping of monitors that track the vital signs of dreams that have been sterilized to death.
