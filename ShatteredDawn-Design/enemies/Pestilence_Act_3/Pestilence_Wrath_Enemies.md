## **Domain Atmosphere**
The Fever Ward echoes with the sounds of medical equipment and the sterile clash of surgical instruments used as weapons. The air smells of antiseptic mixed with the metallic scent of clinical violence, while the lighting is the harsh white of operating theaters. Every surface is spotlessly clean despite the constant conflict, and the silence between battles is broken only by the beeping of machines that monitor nothing but emptiness.
