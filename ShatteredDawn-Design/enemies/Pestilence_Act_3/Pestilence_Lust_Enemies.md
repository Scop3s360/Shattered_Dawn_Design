## **Domain Atmosphere**
The Diseased Brothel gleams with the sterile light of examination rooms disguised as chambers of pleasure. The air smells of antiseptic mixed with artificial perfumes that promise but never deliver, while the sound of medical equipment creates a mechanical rhythm that mimics but never matches a heartbeat. Every surface is perfectly clean but completely cold, and the silence between encounters is broken only by the clinical documentation of empty pleasures.
