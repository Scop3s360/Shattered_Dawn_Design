## **Domain Atmosphere**
The Infected Cathedral gleams with the cold light of surgical lamps and the sterile white of hospital walls. The air tastes of antiseptic and the absence of life, while the sound of medical equipment creates a mechanical hymn to artificial perfection. Every surface is so clean it hurts to look at, and the silence is broken only by the beeping of machines that monitor nothing but emptiness.
