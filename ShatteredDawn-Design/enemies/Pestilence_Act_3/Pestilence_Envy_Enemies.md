## **Domain Atmosphere**
The Jealous Outbreak is filled with mirrors that show only sanitized reflections and copying machines that produce perfect but soulless duplicates. The air tastes of antiseptic and sameness, while the sound of mechanical reproduction echoes through halls where originality goes to die. Every surface reflects the same sterile perfection, and the silence is broken only by the whirring of machines that make everyone identical.
