**Classification:** Domain Boss (Gluttony Lieutenant of Pestilence)
**Description:** The lord of flies transformed into Pestilence's master of empty consumption. His massive form is a living laboratory where everything edible is processed into sterile perfection.

## **Domain Atmosphere**
The Bloated Laboratory hums with the sound of processing equipment and sterilization chambers working to remove all flavor and satisfaction from food. The air smells of antiseptic mixed with the absence of cooking aromas, while the lighting is the harsh fluorescent glare of research facilities. Every surface is covered with nutritional charts and feeding schedules that optimize health while eliminating all pleasure from eating.
