## **Domain Atmosphere**
The Plague Market gleams with the sterile light of surgical lamps reflecting off perfectly clean but empty display cases. The air smells of antiseptic and the absence of commerce, while the sound of cash registers rings hollow with transactions that exchange nothing for nothing. Every surface is so sanitized it has lost all character, and the silence is broken only by the mechanical counting of worthless, sterilized coins.
