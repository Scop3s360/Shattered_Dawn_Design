## **Domain Atmosphere**
The Lover's Grave is filled with the scent of dying roses and expensive perfumes that can't quite mask the underlying decay. Silk curtains flutter in non-existent breezes, and the sound of distant music plays melodies that promise pleasure but deliver only emptiness. Everything here is beautiful from afar but reveals corruption upon closer inspection.
