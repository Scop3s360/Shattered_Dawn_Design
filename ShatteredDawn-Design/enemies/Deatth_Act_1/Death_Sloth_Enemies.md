### **Morpheus the Unwaking**

## **1 Boss Enemy**

### **Belphegor the Void of Ambition**

**Philosophy:** Believes that all effort is ultimately meaningless and that death is simply the final rest. Sees Death's domain as the ultimate sanctuary where no one ever has to try again.

## **Domain Atmosphere**
The Eternal Rest is shrouded in perpetual twilight and filled with the sound of gentle snoring. Beds, couches, and resting places stretch as far as the eye can see, all occupied by figures that may be sleeping or dead. The air is thick and drowsy, and time itself seems to move more slowly here. Dust motes float lazily through shafts of dim light, and everything is covered in a fine layer of neglect.
