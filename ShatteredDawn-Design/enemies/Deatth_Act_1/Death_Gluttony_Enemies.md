## **1 Boss Enemy**

### **Beelzebub the Void-Maw** 
**Classification:** Domain Boss (Gluttony Lieutenant of Death)
**Description:** The ancient demon of gluttony who serves as Death's master of consumption. His form is an ever-shifting mass of mouths, stomachs, and digestive systems. At his center is a black hole that devours light, sound, and hope itself.

## **Domain Atmosphere**
The Consuming Void reeks of decay and digestive acids. Tables laden with rotting feasts stretch into the darkness, and the sound of endless chewing echoes through chambers lined with teeth. The floor is sticky with spilled wine and blood, and everything here exists only to be consumed and forgotten.
