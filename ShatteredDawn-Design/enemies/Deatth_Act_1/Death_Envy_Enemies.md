## **4 Basic Enemies (Normal)**

### **Mimic Wraith**
**Classification:** Normal Enemy
**Description:** Shapeless spirits that constantly shift between different forms, trying to copy the appearance of others but never quite succeeding. Their features blur and distort like reflections in troubled water.

**Description:** Bitter spirits of those who died consumed by envy. They appear as dark silhouettes that grow more solid when near others' success or happiness.
**Behavior:** Becomes stronger when enemies use special abilities or equipment, tries to steal or corrupt anything that makes others superior.

### **Covetous Corpse**
**Classification:** Normal Enemy
**Description:** Reanimated bodies of those who spent their lives wanting what others had. Their empty eye sockets follow every movement, and their grasping hands reach for anything others possess.
**Behavior:** Focuses attacks on whoever has the best equipment or abilities, attempts to steal or break items rather than kill outright.

### **Echo Stalker**
**Classification:** Normal Enemy
**Description:** Hollow beings that exist only as pale imitations of others. They have no original form, appearing as twisted, incomplete copies of whoever they encounter.

### **Proteus the Face-Thief**

### **Lady Invidia the Mirror-Breaker**

## **1 Boss Enemy**

### **Iago the Whisper-Weaver**

## **Domain Atmosphere**
The Copycat Cemetery is filled with broken mirrors and distorted reflections. Every surface shows twisted versions of the viewer, and whispers of comparison and inadequacy echo through the air. The ground is littered with discarded masks and stolen identities, and nothing here is ever quite what it appears to be.
