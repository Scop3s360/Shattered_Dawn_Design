## **Domain Atmosphere**
The Mausoleum of Kings reeks of ancient perfumes mixed with decay. Golden light flickers from enchanted braziers, casting long shadows between towering statues of forgotten rulers. The air itself seems heavy with the weight of accumulated arrogance, and whispers of long-dead courtiers echo through marble halls where no living foot has trod for centuries.
