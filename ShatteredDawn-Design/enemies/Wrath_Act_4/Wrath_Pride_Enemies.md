### **Lucifer the Fallen General** 
**Classification:** Domain Boss (Pride Lieutenant of Wrath)
**Description:** The greatest angel who fell from grace, now Wrath's supreme commander of prideful warfare. His massive form bears the scars of his rebellion against heaven, and his wings are tattered banners that proclaim his defiance. He wields weapons forged from his own broken halos, and his presence turns every battle into a cosmic struggle for supremacy.
