## **2 Hard Enemies (Sin Embracers - Irredeemable)**

### **Marshal Acedia the War-Prolonger**

## **1 Boss Enemy**

### **Chronos the Time-Waster** 
**Classification:** Domain Boss (Sloth Lieutenant of Wrath)
**Description:** The titan of time corrupted into Wrath's master of endless, pointless conflict. His massive form is surrounded by clocks that all show different times, and he wields weapons that slow down decisive moments while accelerating meaningless delays.

## **Domain Atmosphere**
The Endless War stretches across a battlefield where the same conflicts have raged for centuries without resolution. The air is thick with the dust of countless postponed decisions, while the sound of half-hearted combat creates a monotonous rhythm that never builds to a climax. Every surface bears the marks of maintenance without progress, and time itself seems to move slowly, making every moment feel like an eternity of pointless struggle.
