## **Domain Atmosphere**
The Bitter General's Command reeks of suspicion and broken trust. The air tastes of copper and resentment, while the sound of whispered accusations and bitter complaints echoes through command tents where no one trusts their allies. Every surface bears the scars of sabotage and betrayal, and the maps show not enemy positions but the locations of rivals to be undermined.
