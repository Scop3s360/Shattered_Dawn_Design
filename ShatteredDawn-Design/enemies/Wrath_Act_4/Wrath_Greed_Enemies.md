### **Mammon the War-Vault** 
**Classification:** Domain Boss (Greed Lieutenant of Wrath)
**Description:** The demon of greed transformed into Wrath's treasurer of conflict.

## **Domain Atmosphere**
The War Profiteer's Vault echoes with the sound of clinking coins mixed with the clash of weapons being sold and resold. The air smells of gunpowder and greed, while the lighting reflects off mountains of blood-stained currency and weapon stockpiles. Every surface bears price tags and contracts written in languages of commerce and violence, and the silence between battles is filled with the mechanical counting of profits earned from human suffering.
